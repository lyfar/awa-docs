# Prototype 3D Map with FPS Stats

## Feature Name
Prototype 3D Map with FPS Stats

## Overview
The Prototype 3D Map with FPS Stats is a development and testing feature that visualizes the practice journey with an interactive 3D map and provides real-time performance feedback. It loads a 3D map, renders a plane with controls, overlays FPS statistics, and updates in real-time for performance monitoring.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is providing developers and testers with a tool to visualize practice journeys while monitoring performance metrics, ensuring the 3D map system can handle the required load and provide smooth user experiences.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to test the 3D map performance with FPS statistics so that I can ensure smooth rendering and optimal user experience.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a tester, I want to see real-time FPS data during map interactions
- As a developer, I want to monitor performance during different map states
- As a user, I want to experience smooth 3D map interactions
- As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- 3D map rendering with interactive controls
- FPS counter overlay in corner of screen
- Performance metrics display

### User Flow
1. User opens prototype map feature
2. 3D map loads with interactive plane
3. FPS counter appears and starts updating
4. User can interact with map controls

    // Record performance issue
    this.performanceMonitor.recordPerformanceIssue({
      type: 'low_fps',
      fps: fps,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
    
    // Trigger performance optimization
    this.optimizePerformance();
  }

    // Reduce map complexity
    await this.mapRenderer.reduceComplexity();
    
    // Optimize rendering settings
    await this.mapRenderer.optimizeSettings();
    
    // Clear performance caches
    await this.performanceMonitor.clearCaches();
