# Light Ignition v0.2

## Summary

<FeatureSummary />

## Narrative
Light Ignition v0.2 deepens the original glow mechanic with reaction-aware visuals. Instead of a single bright-or-ember state, the globe now reflects the dominant reaction color from the last 24 hours, while profile surfaces expose how the user’s emotional mix is trending. When a practice completes, ignition still flashes instantly, but the light also pulses in the shade tied to the selected state (Grounded, Energy, Peaceful, Release, Insight, Unity, Joy). Subsequent practices layer subtle gradients rather than replacing the spark outright, helping the user see how experiences stack through the day.

The system reads from the Practices Reactions Base, updates the user’s light payload, and broadcasts state changes to the globe, profile home, and practice cards. Fades stay gentle—lights soften over the final six hours with a halo hinting at the new dominant state. Notifications tap into the same data to nudge a user when their light is close to dimming or when a contrasting state might balance their week.

## Interaction
1. Onboarding finale introduces the seven-state palette: as the camera zooms out, the user’s spark cycles briefly through each hue before locking onto their starting state.
2. Practice completion posts a reaction; Light Ignition ingests the update, calculates the new dominant and supporting states, and broadcasts payloads to globe/profile surfaces.
3. Profile View renders the light with a colored aura matching the dominant state and a secondary ring for the runner-up, giving users quick context.
4. Globe clusters show aggregated hues when multiple co-located users practice; hovering or tapping reveals counts per state.
5. During the 24-hour burn, fades adjust saturation rather than switching to gray, telegraphing that energy is waning yet the feeling persists.
6. When the burn window ends, the ember returns to a neutral glow while instrumentation triggers reminder events (e.g., “Spark your Joy again”).

:::caution Edge Case
Back-to-back practices with different reactions must blend colors smoothly; the system averages by weight and animates transitions instead of snapping between hues.
:::

:::tip Signals of Success
- Light updates within one second of reaction submission on both globe and profile.
- Users recognize their dominant state color and can distinguish stacked experiences.
- Fade animations stay calm and never flash or stutter even on low-end devices.

## Requirements
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - GIVEN a reaction posts WHEN Light Ignition recalculates THEN the user’s globe spark updates hue and intensity within one second.
  - GIVEN multiple reactions within 24 hours WHEN the dominant state changes THEN the glow transitions via blended animation, not abrupt swaps.
  - GIVEN the burn window expires WHEN no new practices occur THEN the light shifts to ember while emitting notification events referencing the last dominant state.
- **No-gos & risks**
  - Color assignments that clash with accessibility guidelines or other UI elements.
  - Divergent state calculations between client and server; all logic must pull from Practices Reactions Base.
  - Hard fades to gray that feel punitive or panic-inducing.

## Data
- Primary metric: Time from reaction ingestion to light update across surfaces (target ≤1 s p95).
- Secondary checks: Distribution of dominant states, fade completion rate, and user engagement with follow-up notifications tied to hue changes.
- Telemetry requirements: Log ignition events with state weights, transition durations, fade start/end, and notification triggers.

## Open Questions
- Should we allow users to opt into multi-state displays (e.g., top three rings) in v0.2 or defer to later versions?
- Do we need offline-safe blending logic for spotty connections, or can the client rely on cached hue history?
- How do we visualize shared sessions (e.g., live circles) where multiple dominant states compete in the same locale?
