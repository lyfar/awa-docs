# GDPR Compliance

## One-Glance Summary

<FeatureSummary />

## Narrative
GDPR Compliance operationalizes AWATERRA’s promise of mindful data stewardship. Users must understand what data we collect, why, and how to control it. The experience spans consent flows, profile settings, and backend tooling to honor access, portability, and deletion requests within mandated timelines.

By designing transparent copy and resilient storage practices, we reduce legal risk while strengthening user trust. The system should feel empowering—not bureaucratic.

## Interaction Blueprint
1. Present clear consent choices during signup with granular toggles for communications and data processing.
2. Store consent artifacts with timestamps, policy versions, and geo metadata for audit trails.
3. Expose settings to review and modify preferences later, including notification categories and language.
4. Provide self-service flows to request data exports or deletion, escalating to operations when manual handling is required.
5. Confirm actions via email or in-app receipts so users know their request is acknowledged.
6. Coordinate backend jobs to fulfill access/deletion within regulatory timelines and log completion.

- Edge case: A user withdraws consent while active sessions exist; ensure services revoke tokens and mask data gracefully.

- Signals of success:
  - 100% of signups capture explicit consent and store immutable records.
  - Requests for access or deletion complete within SLA with transparent communication.
  - Audits demonstrate data minimization and least-privilege access.

## Requirements & Guardrails
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - GIVEN a new user WHEN they sign up THEN consent messaging is explicit, unbundled, and recorded with traceable metadata.
  - GIVEN a user updates preferences WHEN the change is saved THEN all dependent services honor the new setting immediately.
  - GIVEN a deletion request WHEN it is completed THEN the profile, associated data, and backups respect erasure policies.
- **No-gos & risks**
  - Bundling multiple consents into a single ambiguous checkbox.
  - Retaining data longer than legally justified or failing to respond within statutory windows.
  - Exposing internal admin tools without strict access control.

## Data & Measurement
- Primary metric: Compliance SLA adherence for consent capture and rights requests.
- Secondary checks: Volume of support escalations, audit findings, and frequency of consent changes.
- Telemetry requirements: Log consent events, preference updates, request lifecycle stages, and admin actions.

## Open Questions
- Which self-service actions can we fully automate in v0.1 versus requiring manual support?
- How do we coordinate consent across future companion apps or web surfaces while maintaining a single source of truth?
