# Localization Management (Keys & Translations)

## Feature Name
Localization Management (Keys & Translations)

## Overview
This feature provides seamless multi-language support for diverse users by managing translation keys and translations centrally. It enables developers to add translation keys, input translations, store keys centrally, and allows users to select their language preference.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is supporting a global user base with diverse language requirements. By providing multi-language support, AWATERRA can reach users worldwide and provide a localized experience.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to use the app in my preferred language so that I can understand and engage with the content effectively.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a developer, I want to easily add new translation keys and translations
- As a content manager, I want to update translations without code changes
- As a user, I want to switch languages smoothly without losing my progress

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Language selection interface
- Consistent typography across languages
- Proper text expansion handling for different languages
- RTL (Right-to-Left) language support

### User Flow
1. User accesses language settings
2. User selects preferred language
3. App updates interface with new language
4. Content displays in selected language
5. User can switch languages at any time

### Accessibility
- Screen reader support for different languages
- Proper language attributes for assistive technologies
- Clear language selection interface

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Language switching interface
- Dynamic text rendering
- RTL language support
- Font and typography handling for different languages

### Backend
- Translation key management system
- Translation storage and retrieval
- Language preference storage
- Translation update APIs

### Data Models
- Translation keys and values
- Language preferences
- Translation metadata (last updated, version)
- Content localization rules

### Integrations
- Translation management systems
- Content delivery networks
- Analytics for language usage

## Dependencies

### Required Capabilities
- [01. App Infrastructure](/docs/capabilities/01-App-Infrastructure) - Backend services and data storage

### Required Features
- User settings and preferences
- Content management system

### External Dependencies
- Translation services (optional)
- Font libraries for different languages

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Planned
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Start Date**: 2025/09/20
- **End Date**: 2025/10/11

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Users can switch languages smoothly
- Translated content displays without errors
- Translation keys are centrally managed
- Developers can easily add new translations
- Language preferences are persisted

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Language switching completes within 1 second
- All text content is properly translated
- No missing translation keys
- Proper handling of text expansion
- Support for RTL languages

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for translation key management
- Integration tests for language switching
- UI tests for different language layouts
- Content validation for all supported languages

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Use proper internationalization (i18n) libraries
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing translations
- Consider text expansion for different languages
- Use proper encoding for special characters
- Implement lazy loading for translation data

### Design Considerations
- Design interfaces that work with different text lengths
- Consider cultural differences in UI design
- Ensure proper spacing for different languages
- Test with actual translated content, not placeholder text

### Risk Factors
- Missing translations causing UI breaks
- Text expansion breaking layouts
- Cultural sensitivity in translations
- Performance impact of loading multiple languages
- Maintenance overhead of keeping translations updated

## Examples

### Implementation Tasks
- Set up translation key management system
- Create language selection interface
- Implement dynamic text rendering
- Add RTL language support
- Create translation update workflow

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example translation key management
const translations = {
  en: {
    'welcome.title': 'Welcome to AWATERRA',
    'practice.start': 'Start Practice'
  },
  es: {
    'welcome.title': 'Bienvenido a AWATERRA',
    'practice.start': 'Iniciar PrÃ¡ctica'
  }
};

// Language switching
const switchLanguage = (languageCode) => {
  const currentTranslations = translations[languageCode];
  updateUIWithTranslations(currentTranslations);
  saveLanguagePreference(languageCode);
};
```
