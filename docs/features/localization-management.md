# Localization Management (Keys & Translations)

## One-Glance Summary

<FeatureSummary />

## Narrative
Localization Management ensures AWATERRA feels native regardless of language. Engineers and content partners collaborate on a central registry of translation keys, then populate locale files so every string in the experience stays in sync.

By coupling runtime language selection with rigorous validation, the app updates text, layouts, and assets instantly when a user switches preferences. Transparent fallbacks and monitoring help flag missing keys before they affect live audiences.

## Interaction Blueprint
1. Define canonical translation keys for product surfaces inside the central repository.
2. Populate locale files with approved translations and store them in version controlled storage.
3. Integrate the i18n service with the app shell so it loads language packs on boot.
4. Expose settings controls for language selection and persist the choice to user preferences.
5. Render screens in the selected language and validate dynamic content for text expansion.
6. Run automated audits that detect missing keys, RTL regressions, or stale translations before release.

- Edge case: A new build ships without translated copy for a key; the fallback mechanism should surface the default language and log the gap for fast remediation.

- Signals of success:
  - Users can change language without relaunching and keep their active session.
  - Translation completeness stays at or above 98 percent across supported locales.
  - Automated audits report zero critical missing key or RTL issues for launch builds.

## Requirements & Guardrails
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - GIVEN a supported language WHEN the user switches preferences THEN all navigation, system copy, and dynamic strings update instantly without reload.
  - GIVEN new translation keys WHEN build validation runs THEN missing or outdated translations are flagged and cannot pass without review.
  - GIVEN an RTL locale WHEN the app renders THEN layouts, typography, and input affordances mirror correctly.
- **No-gos & risks**
  - Do not allow hard coded strings in the product surfaces.
  - Avoid releasing locales without proofread translations and QA sign off.
  - Prevent silent fallback failures that hide missing translations from analytics.

## Data & Measurement
- Primary metric: Translation coverage per locale (target 98 percent or higher each sprint).
- Secondary checks: Average language switch latency under 800 milliseconds, count of missing key alerts per release train.
- Telemetry requirements: Log language change events, missing key incidents, and locale specific errors for analytics review.

## Open Questions
- Which locales are in scope for the 0.1 launch versus fast followers?
- How will we handle dynamic content translations from community or partner feeds?
- Do we need in-product copy review workflows for regulated regions?
