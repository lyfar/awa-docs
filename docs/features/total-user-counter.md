# Total User Counter

## Feature Name
Total User Counter

## Overview
The Total User Counter is a visualization feature that displays the total number of active users connected to the AWATERRA system. It shows community scale and reinforces belonging by aggregating user metrics and displaying a single counter with smooth animations.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is creating a sense of community scale and belonging, allowing users to see how many people are part of the AWATERRA community and feel connected to a larger movement.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see how many people are currently active in the AWATERRA community so that I can feel part of something larger and meaningful.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a user, I want to see the counter update in real-time
- As a user, I want to feel proud of being part of a growing community
- As a user, I want to see the counter in different contexts (home screen, pulse screen)
- As a user, I want to understand what the counter represents

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Large, prominent counter display
- Smooth counting animations
- Real-time updates with smooth transitions
- Clear typography and readability
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Visual indicators for growth trends

### User Flow
1. User opens home or Pulse screen/widget
2. System fetches total active users
3. Counter aggregates across metrics
4. Single counter displays with smooth animation
5. Counter updates in real-time
6. User sees current community size

### Accessibility
- Clear, readable counter display
- Alternative text for counter value
- Haptic feedback for significant changes
- Screen reader support for counter updates

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Counter display component
- Smooth animation system
- Real-time update handling
- Responsive design implementation
- Accessibility features
- Visual trend indicators

### Backend
- Active user counting system
- Real-time data aggregation
- User activity tracking
- Counter update APIs
- Analytics for community growth
- Performance optimization

### Data Models
- Active user metrics
- Counter update history
- Community growth data
- User activity timestamps
- Counter display settings
- Analytics data

### Integrations
- Real-time data streaming
- User activity tracking
- Analytics platform
- Performance monitoring
- Community engagement metrics

## Dependencies

### Required Capabilities
- [02. Visualization & Map Layer](/docs/capabilities/02-Visualization-Map-Layer) - Core visualization system
- [01. App Infrastructure](/docs/capabilities/01-App-Infrastructure) - Backend services and user tracking

### Required Features
- User activity tracking
- Real-time data processing
- Counter visualization system
- Analytics platform

### External Dependencies
- Real-time data services
- User tracking systems
- Analytics platform
- Performance monitoring tools

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Done (To Do)
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Start Date**: TBD
- **End Date**: TBD

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Counter is visible and matches total users connected to system
- Real-time updates work correctly
- Smooth animations for counter changes
- Accurate user counting
- Responsive design for all devices
- Performance optimized for large numbers

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Counter updates within 10 seconds
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Accurate user counting
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Battery efficient data processing

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for user counting logic
- Integration tests for real-time updates
- Performance tests for large user counts
- User experience tests for counter display
- End-to-end tests for complete counter flow

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Implement efficient user counting algorithms
- Use proper data aggregation for performance
- Consider performance impact of large user counts
- Implement proper caching for counter updates
- Design for scalability with growing user base

### Design Considerations
- Design counter to feel impressive and motivating
- Ensure counter is readable at all sizes
- Consider different number formats for different regions
- Design for emotional impact and community pride
- Consider accessibility for users with visual impairments

### Risk Factors
- Performance issues with large user counts
- Data synchronization failures
- Counter accuracy problems
- Battery drain from continuous updates
- User experience issues with complex animations

## Examples

### Counter Display
- **Format**: "23,456 participants"
- **Real-time Updates**: Smooth counting animations
- **Context**: Home screen, Pulse screen, widgets
- **Growth Indicators**: Visual trends and growth patterns

### Implementation Tasks
- Implement user counting system
- Create counter display component
- Build smooth animation system
- Develop real-time update mechanism
- Add responsive design
- Implement accessibility features

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example Total User Counter implementation
class TotalUserCounterService {
  constructor() {
    this.currentCount = 0;
    this.updateInterval = 10000; // 10 seconds
    this.isUpdating = false;

        this.getRecentActivityUsers(),
        this.getEngagedUsers()
      ]);
      
      // Calculate total unique users
      const totalUsers = this.calculateUniqueUsers(metrics);

    }
  }

    const [activeUsers, onlineUsers, recentUsers, engagedUsers] = metrics;
    
    // Combine and deduplicate user IDs
    const allUserIds = new Set([
      ...activeUsers.map(u => u.id),
      ...onlineUsers.map(u => u.id),

    ]);
    
    return allUserIds.size;

  async updateCounter() {
    if (this.isUpdating) return;
    
    this.isUpdating = true;
    
    try {
      const newCount = await this.fetchTotalActiveUsers();
      
      if (newCount !== this.currentCount) {
        await this.animateCounterChange(this.currentCount, newCount);
        this.currentCount = newCount;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Counter update failed:', error);
    } finally {
      this.isUpdating = false;
    }
  }
  
  async animateCounterChange(fromCount, toCount) {
    const duration = 1000; // 1 second
    const steps = 60; // 60fps
    const stepDuration = duration / steps;
    const countDifference = toCount - fromCount;
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= steps; i++) {
      const progress = i / steps;
      const currentCount = Math.round(fromCount + (countDifference * progress));
      
      await this.updateCounterDisplay(currentCount);
      await this.sleep(stepDuration);
    }
  }
  
  async updateCounterDisplay(count) {
    // Update UI with formatted count
    const formattedCount = this.formatCount(count);
    await this.uiService.updateCounterDisplay(formattedCount);
  }
  
  formatCount(count) {
    if (count >= 1000000) {
      return `${(count / 1000000).toFixed(1)}M participants`;
    } else if (count >= 1000) {
      return `${(count / 1000).toFixed(1)}K participants`;
    } else {
      return `${count.toLocaleString()} participants`;
    }
  }
  
  startRealTimeUpdates() {
    setInterval(() => {
      this.updateCounter();
    }, this.updateInterval);
  }
}
