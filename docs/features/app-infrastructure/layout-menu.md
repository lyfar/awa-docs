# Layout/Menu

## Feature Name
Layout/Menu

## Overview
This feature defines the overall layout and menu structure of the AWATERRA application. It provides the foundational UI/UX design framework that determines how users navigate through the app and access different features and sections.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is providing a consistent, intuitive navigation experience that allows users to easily access all features and content within the AWATERRA platform.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to easily navigate through the app using a clear menu structure so that I can find and access all features quickly.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a user, I want consistent navigation across all screens
- As a user, I want to understand where I am in the app at all times
- As a user, I want quick access to my most-used features
- As a user, I want the navigation to work on different screen sizes

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Consistent navigation bar and menu design
- Clear visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessible navigation elements
- Brand-consistent styling and theming

### User Flow
1. User opens the app
2. User sees main navigation structure
3. User can access different sections via menu
4. User can navigate between features seamlessly
5. User always knows their current location

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Clear focus indicators
- Proper heading structure
- Accessible menu labels

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Navigation component architecture
- Menu state management
- Responsive layout system
- Theme and styling system
- Accessibility features

### Backend
- Menu configuration management
- User preference storage for navigation
- Analytics for navigation usage
- Content management for menu items

### Data Models
- Menu structure and hierarchy
- User navigation preferences
- Feature access permissions
- Navigation analytics data

### Integrations
- User authentication for personalized menus
- Analytics for navigation tracking
- Content management for menu updates

## Dependencies

### Required Capabilities
- [01. App Infrastructure](/docs/capabilities/01-App-Infrastructure) - Backend services and user management

### Required Features
- User authentication and profiles
- Feature access control
- Content management system

### External Dependencies
- UI framework and component library
- Analytics and tracking tools

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: High

- Ensure clear visual hierarchy
- Design for different user types and permissions
- Consider future feature additions

### Risk Factors
- Navigation complexity confusing users
- Performance issues with complex layouts
- Accessibility compliance challenges
- Maintenance overhead with complex navigation
- User experience inconsistencies

## Examples

### Implementation Tasks
- Design main navigation structure
- Create responsive layout system
- Implement menu state management
- Add accessibility features
- Create theme and styling system

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example navigation component
const NavigationMenu = () => {
  const [activeSection, setActiveSection] = useState('home');
  const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);
  
  const menuItems = [
    { id: 'home', label: 'Home', icon: 'home', path: '/' },
    { id: 'practices', label: 'Practices', icon: 'play', path: '/practices' },
    { id: 'profile', label: 'Profile', icon: 'user', path: '/profile' },
    { id: 'settings', label: 'Settings', icon: 'settings', path: '/settings' }
  ];
  
  return (
    <nav className="navigation-menu">
      <div className="menu-toggle" onClick={() => setIsMenuOpen(!isMenuOpen)}>
        <MenuIcon />
      </div>
      <div className={`menu-items ${isMenuOpen ? 'open' : ''}`}>
        {menuItems.map(item => (
          <MenuItem
            key={item.id}
            item={item}
            isActive={activeSection === item.id}
            onClick={() => setActiveSection(item.id)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
};
```
