# App Architecture and Base

## Feature Name
App Architecture and Base

## Overview
This feature establishes the core application architecture and base foundation that ensures reliable app performance and data security. It includes the initialization of app architecture, database loading, data synchronization, and stability and security measures.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is providing a solid foundation for the AWATERRA app that ensures reliable performance, data security, and maintainable codebase architecture.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the app to start reliably and access my data securely so that I can have a consistent and safe experience.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a developer, I want a well-structured codebase that is easy to maintain and extend
- As a user, I want my data to be synchronized across devices
- As a user, I want the app to perform consistently without crashes

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Loading screens during app initialization
- Error states for failed initialization
- Progress indicators for data synchronization

### User Flow
1. App launches and initializes architecture
2. Loads databases and synchronizes data
3. Ensures stability and security measures
4. App is ready for user interaction

### Accessibility
- Clear loading states and progress indicators
- Accessible error messages
- Proper focus management during initialization

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- App initialization and bootstrapping
- State management architecture
- Error handling and recovery
- Loading and progress indicators
- Offline data handling

### Backend
- Database initialization and connection management
- Data synchronization services
- Security middleware and authentication
- Error handling and logging
- Performance monitoring

### Data Models
- Core application data schemas
- User session management
- Caching strategies
- Offline data models

### Integrations
- Database systems
- Authentication services
- Analytics platforms
- Crash reporting tools

## Dependencies

### Required Capabilities
- [01. App Infrastructure](/docs/capabilities/01-App-Infrastructure) - Backend services and infrastructure

### Required Features
- None (this is a foundational feature)

### External Dependencies
- Database systems
- Authentication providers
- Analytics and crash reporting tools

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Start Date**: 2025/08/30
- **End Date**: 2025/09/19

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- App starts without errors
- Databases are accessible and responsive
- Data synchronization works correctly
- Security measures are properly implemented
- Error handling provides clear feedback

### Non-Functional Requirements
- App startup time under 3 seconds
- Database queries optimized for performance
- Secure data transmission and storage
- Proper error logging and monitoring
- Offline functionality for core features

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for core architecture components
- Integration tests for database connectivity
- Performance tests for app startup
- Security tests for data protection
- End-to-end tests for initialization flow

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Implement proper error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Design for offline-first functionality
- Use proper state management patterns

### Design Considerations
- Design loading states that provide clear feedback
- Ensure error messages are user-friendly
- Consider progressive loading for better perceived performance

### Risk Factors
- Database connection failures
- Data synchronization conflicts
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues during initialization
- Memory leaks in long-running sessions

## Examples

### Implementation Tasks
- [Arch] Project base
- [Arch] Documentation

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example app initialization
class AppInitializer {
  async initialize() {
    try {
      await this.initializeDatabase();
      await this.loadUserData();
      await this.setupSecurity();
      await this.synchronizeData();
      this.setupErrorHandling();
    } catch (error) {
      this.handleInitializationError(error);
    }
  }
  
  async initializeDatabase() {
    // Database connection and schema setup
  }
  
  async synchronizeData() {
    // Data synchronization logic
  }
}
```
