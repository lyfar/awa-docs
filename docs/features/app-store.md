# App Store Presence

## One-Glance Summary

<FeatureSummary />

## Narrative
App Store Presence ensures AWATERRA’s first impression in marketplaces reflects the product’s essence. The work covers visuals, copy, compliance checklists, and release workflows. A polished listing improves conversion, communicates value, and avoids costly approval delays.

## Interaction Blueprint
1. Draft positioning statements, screenshots, and preview videos that align with brand tone.
2. Localize metadata for supported languages, including subtitle, keywords, and description.
3. Configure App Store Connect settings: bundle identifiers, pricing, territories, and age ratings.
4. Integrate review checklists (privacy manifests, ATT rationale, contact information).
5. Run internal reviews and legal/brand approvals before submission.
6. Schedule releases, monitor review status, and respond to feedback post-launch.

- Edge case: Store rejection citing policy issues; maintain a rapid escalation path with corrected assets or clarifications.

- Signals of success:
  - Listing approval on first submission with minimal revisions.
  - Healthy view-to-install conversion driven by resonant messaging and visuals.
  - Timely updates synced with product releases and campaign timelines.

## Requirements & Guardrails
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - GIVEN assets WHEN exported THEN they meet platform specs (sizes, formats) and pass QA.
  - GIVEN metadata WHEN localized THEN translations are accurate and culturally appropriate.
  - GIVEN submission WHEN sent THEN privacy disclosures and policy texts are complete.
- **No-gos & risks**
  - Misrepresenting product capabilities leading to bad reviews or rejection.
  - Missing legal copy (privacy policy, support contact).
  - Allowing outdated screenshots to linger after major redesigns.

## Data & Measurement
- Primary metric: Conversion rate from store impressions to installs.
- Secondary checks: Review sentiment, approval turnaround time, and listing update cadence.
- Telemetry requirements: Track asset versioning, submission timestamps, and review outcomes.

## Open Questions
- Which seasonal moments or feature launches warrant alternative store creatives?
- Do we invest in App Store A/B testing (Product Page Optimization) in v0.1?
