# Welcome Animation

## One-Glance Summary

<FeatureSummary />

## Narrative
The Welcome Animation bridges Loading Screen and onboarding. It invites users to share their name, watch the globe awaken, and feel the presence of AWA Soul guiding the experience. Motion is purposeful: light flows outward, hinting at the global network they are about to join.

This sequence is also functional. It sets context for location access, primes the user for community participation, and transitions gracefully into the guided setup without breaking immersion.

## Interaction Blueprint
1. Launch the welcome scene after the loading sequence on first run or post-update resets.
2. Animate the globe and AWA Soul elements while displaying the hero copy about shared light.
3. Collect the userâ€™s preferred name and confirm consent before proceeding.
4. Introduce geolocation benefits and prepare for the permission request.
5. Offer controls to continue, skip, or learn more, maintaining a gentle pace.
6. Persist onboarding progress so returning users skip or resume appropriately.

- Edge case: Users may skip quickly; ensure essential context (name capture, location rationale) surfaces later if bypassed.

- Signals of success:
  - High completion rate of the welcome flow with minimal friction.
  - Users provide their name and consent signals without confusion.
  - Transitions to subsequent onboarding steps remain smooth and thematically aligned.

## Requirements & Guardrails
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - GIVEN a new user WHEN the welcome animation plays THEN prompts for name and context are clear and skippable without losing essential information.
  - GIVEN accessibility preferences WHEN reduced motion is enabled THEN animation simplifies but still conveys warmth.
  - GIVEN a returning user WHEN the app launches THEN the animation only replays after significant updates or when the user opts in.
- **No-gos & risks**
  - Overly long sequences that delay onboarding.
  - Mandatory name collection without explanation diminishes trust.
  - Location requests without clear value proposition risk denial.

## Data & Measurement
- Primary metric: Completion rate of the welcome flow including successful name capture.
- Secondary checks: Permission acceptance rates following the sequence, skip frequency, and user sentiment.
- Telemetry requirements: Log animation start/end, input submissions, skips, and permission prompt follow-through.

## Open Questions
- Should the animation adapt copy or visuals based on locale or time of day in v0.1?
- How soon should we replay the welcome experience for returning users (e.g., major releases, seasonal moments)?
