# Setup Backend Infrastructure

## Summary

<FeatureSummary />

## Narrative
Setup Backend Infrastructure builds the technical spine that keeps AWATERRA available, secure, and fast. The work covers provisioning services, wiring authentication, and building core APIs for the first release.

We bring systems online in a controlled sequence so mobile clients reach critical data paths with confidence. Monitoring, logging, and automated backups give operations visibility from day one. Because the product launches without registration, the backend anchors session state per device while preparing escape hatches for continuityâ€”most notably a QR-based handoff that lets a user move their local account to a new handset without exposing credentials.

Parity across Apple and Android remains non-negotiable. Services must normalize platform-specific push tokens, secure enclave storage, and vendor APIs so Flutter clients can rely on the same contract regardless of the runtime hosting them.

## Interaction
1. Configure cloud service accounts and baseline access policies for the environment.
2. Provision compute, database, and storage resources, then prepare the baseline data structures for launch.
3. Deploy the core service layer and expose the essential launch endpoints.
4. Integrate authentication, media storage, and secure domain settings so clients can connect confidently.
5. Enable observability with performance, reliability, and incident dashboards.
6. Run connectivity and load smoke tests across Wi-Fi and cellular profiles, then share monitoring access with operators.
7. Validate session continuity tooling, including QR handoff flows, on both Apple and Android reference devices.

:::caution Edge Case
A service comes up without the expected network rules and blocks mobile traffic. Revert to the safe policy baseline and retest before going live.
:::

:::tip Signals of Success
- Core APIs respond within target thresholds across staged network profiles.
- Heartbeat monitors stay green with no unauthorized errors during soak tests.
- Observability dashboards show live traffic and alerting without manual intervention.

## Operating Principles
- Launch v0.1 without formal registration while keeping session data encrypted per device.
- Offer a secure session transfer path (e.g., QR code handshake) so users can migrate to a new device without losing history.
- Maintain feature parity across Apple and Android clients, abstracting vendor-specific services behind the same API surface for Flutter.

## Requirements
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - GIVEN the production infrastructure WHEN the service layer is live THEN the core user journeys respond successfully and report healthy status signals.
  - GIVEN the launch domain and certificates WHEN users access secure areas of the product THEN the experience remains trusted with no security warnings or broken sessions.
  - GIVEN the observability tooling WHEN platform health slips outside agreed thresholds THEN alerts notify the on-call owner with actionable context.
  - GIVEN a user upgrades or replaces their device WHEN they initiate the QR-based session handoff THEN the backend links the new device, retires the old token, and maintains encrypted history without exposing identity data.
- **No-gos & risks**
  - Do not expose databases or storage buckets without restricted access policies.
  - Avoid skipping backup configuration or runbook documentation for critical services.
  - Prevent cost spikes by right sizing resources and tagging spend owners from day one.

## Data
- Primary metric: API success rate for core endpoints during smoke and load tests (target 99.5 percent or higher).
- Secondary checks: Median response time under 200 ms, error budget burn rate during soak, backup job completion status.
- Telemetry requirements: Track heartbeat uptime, latency percentiles, deployment events, and alert firing in analytics pipelines.
