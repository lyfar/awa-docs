# Setup Backend Infrastructure

## Feature Name
Setup Backend Infrastructure

## Overview
This feature establishes the foundational backend infrastructure that enables the AWATERRA app to run reliably with scalable backend services. It includes server provisioning, database configuration, API setup, authentication integration, storage systems, and monitoring infrastructure.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is providing a reliable, scalable foundation for the AWATERRA platform. Without proper backend infrastructure, the app cannot function, making this a critical foundation for all other features.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As an engineering team, I need to set up core infrastructure for launch so that the app can run reliably and scale with user growth.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a developer, I need access to monitoring dashboards to track system health
- As an admin, I need reliable database access for content management
- As a user, I need fast, responsive API calls for smooth app experience

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Monitoring dashboard interfaces
- Admin panel for infrastructure management
- API documentation interfaces

### User Flow
1. Provision servers and cloud resources
2. Configure database and storage systems
3. Set up APIs and authentication
4. Deploy monitoring and backup systems
5. Test all core services
6. Provide access to monitoring dashboards

### Accessibility
- Accessible monitoring dashboards
- Clear error messages and status indicators
- Proper contrast for admin interfaces

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Monitoring dashboard UI
- Admin panel interfaces
- API documentation site

### Backend
- Server provisioning and configuration
- Database setup and optimization
- API development and deployment
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Cloud storage integration
- Monitoring and logging systems

### Data Models
- User data schemas
- Practice content models
- Analytics data structures
- System configuration models

### Integrations
- Cloud service providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Database systems (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Authentication providers
- Monitoring tools (Datadog, Grafana)
- Firebase Performance & Crashlytics

## Dependencies

### Required Capabilities
- [01. App Infrastructure](/docs/capabilities/01-App-Infrastructure) - Core infrastructure foundation

### Required Features
- None (this is a foundational feature)

### External Dependencies
- Cloud service providers
- Database systems
- Monitoring and analytics tools
- SSL certificate providers

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
- **Start Date**: 2025/09/02
- **End Date**: 2025/09/15

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Backend is live and stable
- All core services respond correctly
- Database is accessible and optimized
- APIs are functional and documented
- Monitoring dashboards are accessible
- SSL certificates are configured

### Non-Functional Requirements
- 99.9% uptime target
- API response times under 200ms
- Database queries optimized for performance
- Secure authentication and data encryption
- Automated backup systems

### Testing Requirements
- API connectivity tests (200 requests)
- Load testing for scalability
- Security penetration testing
- Database performance testing
- Monitoring system validation

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) for reproducible deployments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring from day one
- Set up automated backups and disaster recovery
- Use containerization for consistent deployments
- Implement proper security measures and access controls

### Design Considerations
- Design monitoring dashboards for easy troubleshooting
- Create clear API documentation for developers
- Ensure admin interfaces are intuitive and efficient

### Risk Factors
- Cloud service outages
- Database performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Scaling challenges with user growth
- Cost management for cloud resources

## Examples

### Implementation Tasks
- Configure service accounts
- Setup database
- Setup cloud storage
- Create basic NestJS application
- Implement POST /map
- Implement GET /heartbeat
- Configure domain and SSL certificates
- Setup Firebase Performance & Crashlytics
- Setup Datadog/Grafana dashboards
- Configure network test profiles (Wi-Fi/4G, Network Link Conditioner)
- API connectivity test (200 requests)
- Provide monitoring dashboard links

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example API endpoint implementation
app.post('/map', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { userId, practiceData } = req.body;
    const result = await mapService.updateUserPractice(userId, practiceData);
    res.json({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```
