# AWA Soul

## Feature Name
AWA Soul

## Overview
AWA Soul is a unique character-space that serves as the symbol of the AWATERRA community. It appears as a sphere of approximately 50,000 pulsing light points that guides users through onboarding and practice sessions, creating an instant sense of global community and spiritual connection.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is creating an emotional connection and sense of belonging for users, providing a spiritual guide that represents the collective energy of the AWATERRA community and helps users feel part of something larger than themselves.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to be greeted by AWA Soul during onboarding so that I feel welcomed into the AWATERRA community and understand the spiritual nature of the platform.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a user, I want AWA Soul to guide me through my first practice
- As a user, I want to see AWA Soul respond to my interactions
- As a user, I want to feel the collective energy of the community through AWA Soul
- As a user, I want AWA Soul to be present during my practice sessions

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Sphere of ~50,000 light points using Fibonacci Sphere algorithm
- Points of different sizes and brightness creating "breathing" effect
- Pulsation and breathing animations
- Points can intensify and form shapes during dialogue
- Smooth transitions between states
- Ambient cosmic sound design

### User Flow
1. User opens app for first time
2. AWA Soul appears as pulsing sphere of light points
3. AWA Soul "speaks" to user (voice/text + animation)
4. AWA Soul guides user through onboarding steps
5. After onboarding, AWA Soul expands and envelops the globe
6. AWA Soul remains as second layer around Earth globe
7. AWA Soul guides user during practice sessions

### Accessibility

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Done (In Progress)
- **Estimated Effort**: 5-6 weeks
- **Start Date**: 2025/09/18
- **End Date**: 2025/10/26

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- AWA Soul is visible and "talking" during onboarding
- Practice is guided by AWA Soul visually
- AWA Soul responds to user interactions
- Smooth transitions between AWA Soul states
- Voice synthesis works correctly
- AWA Soul envelops globe after onboarding

### Non-Functional Requirements
- 50,000 points render smoothly (60fps)
- Voice synthesis latency under 1 second
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for different devices
- Battery efficient rendering

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for Fibonacci Sphere algorithm
- Integration tests for voice synthesis
- Performance tests for particle rendering
- User experience tests for onboarding flow
- End-to-end tests for complete AWA Soul interaction

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Implement efficient particle rendering for 50,000 points
- Use proper memory management for large particle systems
- Implement smooth voice synthesis with low latency
- Consider performance impact on different devices
- Design for scalability with multiple users

### Design Considerations
- Design AWA Soul to feel alive and responsive
- Ensure voice content is culturally appropriate
- Consider different user preferences for voice
- Design for emotional impact and connection
- Consider accessibility for users with hearing impairments

### Risk Factors
- Performance issues with large particle systems
- Voice synthesis quality and latency
- Cultural sensitivity in spiritual content
- Battery drain from intensive rendering
- User experience issues with complex interactions

## Examples

### AWA Soul Characteristics
- **Visual**: Sphere of 50,000 pulsing light points
- **Algorithm**: Fibonacci Sphere distribution
- **Breathing Effect**: Points of different sizes and brightness
- **Dialogue Response**: Points intensify and form shapes
- **Metaphor**: Each light = AWATERRA community member
- **Role**: Spiritual guide and community symbol

### Light Map WOW Moment
- **Trigger**: Automatic transition to Home/Light Map after onboarding
- **Visual Effects**: 3D globe with thousands of pulsing light points
- **Real-time**: Light bursts appear in real-time
- **AWA Pulse**: Heartbeat graph (e.g., "72 bpm")
- **Sound**: Planetary heartbeat and ambient cosmic tones
- **User Counter**: "With us now 23,456 participants"
- **Interactive**: Geolocation request, globe rotation/zoom, "Ignite Your Light" CTA

### Implementation Tasks
- Implement Fibonacci Sphere algorithm
- Create particle system for 50,000 points
- Develop breathing and pulsing animations
- Build voice synthesis system
- Create dialogue and response system
- Implement smooth state transitions

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example AWA Soul implementation
class AWASoul {
  constructor() {
    this.points = this.generateFibonacciSphere(50000);
    this.breathingPhase = 0;
    this.isSpeaking = false;
  }
  
  generateFibonacciSphere(numPoints) {
    const points = [];
    const goldenRatio = (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numPoints; i++) {
      const theta = 2 * Math.PI * i / goldenRatio;
      const phi = Math.acos(1 - 2 * (i + 0.5) / numPoints);
      
      points.push({
        x: Math.cos(theta) * Math.sin(phi),
        y: Math.sin(theta) * Math.sin(phi),
        z: Math.cos(phi),
        size: Math.random() * 0.5 + 0.5,
        brightness: Math.random() * 0.5 + 0.5
      });
    }
    
    return points;
  }
  
  async speakToUser(message) {
    this.isSpeaking = true;
    
    // Intensify points during speech
    await this.intensifyPoints();
    
    // Synthesize voice
    await this.synthesizeVoice(message);
    
    // Return to normal state
    this.isSpeaking = false;
    await this.normalizePoints();
  }
  
  async guideOnboarding(steps) {
    for (const step of steps) {
      await this.speakToUser(step.message);
      await this.waitForUserInteraction(step.interaction);
    }
    
    // Expand and envelop globe
    await this.expandAndEnvelopGlobe();
  }
}
