# AWA Pulse (Basic)

## Feature Name
AWA Pulse (Basic)

## Overview
AWA Pulse (Basic) is a core visualization feature that allows users to feel connected by seeing the live "pulse" of the AWATERRA system. It collects defined metrics, applies a formula to calculate beats per interval, and renders a pulse visualization that represents the collective vitality of the community.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is creating a sense of connection and community vitality, allowing users to see the real-time health and energy of the global AWATERRA community through a heartbeat-like visualization.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see the live pulse of the AWATERRA system so that I can feel connected to the global community and understand the collective energy.

### Secondary User Stories
- As a user, I want to see the pulse increase when I complete a practice
- As a user, I want to receive notifications when the pulse is low
- As a user, I want to understand what the pulse represents
- As a user, I want to see the pulse in different contexts (home screen, practice screen)

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Heartbeat-like pulse visualization
- Real-time pulse rate display (e.g., "72 bpm")
- Smooth pulse animation
- Color coding for pulse intensity
- Pulse graph/chart visualization
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### User Flow
1. User opens Pulse screen or widget
2. System collects defined metrics
3. Formula calculates beats per interval
4. Pulse visualization renders
5. User sees current pulse value
6. Pulse updates in real-time
7. User can view pulse history

### Accessibility
- Audio pulse representation
- Haptic feedback for pulse changes
- Clear visual indicators for pulse intensity
- Alternative text for pulse data

## Technical Requirements

## Version Information

- **Target Version**: 0.1 Photon
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Done (To Do)
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
- **Start Date**: 2025/09/27
- **End Date**: 2025/10/03

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Pulse value is displayed clearly as system vitality
- Pulse increases when user finishes practice (+8-15%)
- Low pulse triggers push notifications
- Real-time updates work correctly
- Historical pulse data is accessible
- Pulse visualization is smooth and responsive

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Pulse updates within 5 seconds
- Visualization renders smoothly (60fps)
- Accurate pulse calculations
- Responsive design for all devices
- Battery efficient data processing

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for pulse calculation logic
- Integration tests for real-time updates
- Performance tests for data processing
- User experience tests for visualization
- End-to-end tests for complete pulse flow

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Implement efficient real-time data processing
- Use proper algorithms for pulse calculation
- Consider performance impact of continuous updates
- Implement proper error handling for data failures
- Design for scalability with growing user base

### Design Considerations
- Design pulse visualization to feel alive and organic
- Ensure pulse representation is intuitive
- Consider different user preferences for visualization
- Design for emotional impact and connection
- Consider accessibility for users with visual impairments

### Risk Factors
- Performance issues with real-time data processing
- Pulse calculation accuracy
- Data synchronization failures
- Battery drain from continuous updates
- User experience issues with complex visualizations

## Examples

### Pulse Triggers
- **User Practice Completion**: +8-15% pulse increase
- **Low Pulse Detection**: Triggers push notifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous pulse monitoring
- **System Health**: Overall community vitality

### Implementation Tasks
- [Pulse] UI - heart beat
- [Pulse] Usecase - heart beat - Request data with some period
- [Pulse] Net data - heart beat
- [API][Pulse] GET /heartbeat

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example AWA Pulse implementation
class AWAPulseService {
  constructor() {
    this.metrics = new Map();
    this.pulseHistory = [];
    this.currentPulse = 0;
  }
  
  async calculatePulse() {
    try {
      // Collect defined metrics
      const metrics = await this.collectMetrics();
      
      // Apply formula to calculate beats per interval
      const pulse = await this.applyPulseFormula(metrics);
      
      // Update current pulse
      this.currentPulse = pulse;
      
      // Store in history
      this.pulseHistory.push({
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        pulse: pulse,
        metrics: metrics
      });
      
      // Check for low pulse notification
      if (pulse < this.lowPulseThreshold) {
        await this.triggerLowPulseNotification();
      }
      
      return pulse;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(`Pulse calculation failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
  
  async collectMetrics() {
    return {
      activeUsers: await this.getActiveUserCount(),
      practiceCompletions: await this.getPracticeCompletions(),
      systemHealth: await this.getSystemHealth(),
      communityEngagement: await this.getCommunityEngagement()
    };
  }
  
  async applyPulseFormula(metrics) {
    // Custom formula for pulse calculation
    const basePulse = 60;
    const userFactor = metrics.activeUsers * 0.1;
    const practiceFactor = metrics.practiceCompletions * 0.5;
    const healthFactor = metrics.systemHealth * 0.3;
    const engagementFactor = metrics.communityEngagement * 0.2;
    
    return Math.round(basePulse + userFactor + practiceFactor + healthFactor + engagementFactor);
  }
  
  async triggerLowPulseNotification() {
    await this.notificationService.send({
      type: 'low_pulse',
      message: 'The AWA Pulse is low. Help energize the community!',
      priority: 'high'
    });
  }
}
```
