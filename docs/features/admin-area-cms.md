# Admin Area v0.1 (CRM/CMS)

## Feature Name
Admin Area v0.1 (CRM/CMS)

## Overview
This feature provides a basic admin area that simplifies content management for the AWATERRA platform. It enables administrators to control and manage practices through a web-based interface with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Purpose
The business need this feature addresses is providing administrators with the ability to manage content and practices without requiring technical knowledge or direct database access.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I want to access and modify practices through a web interface so that I can manage content efficiently.

### Secondary User Stories
- As an admin, I want to create new practices and content
- As an admin, I want to update existing practices
- As an admin, I want to delete outdated practices
- As an admin, I want to view analytics about practice usage

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Clean, intuitive admin interface
- Clear navigation and menu structure
- Form layouts for practice management
- Data tables for practice listings
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### User Flow
1. Admin logs into the dashboard
2. Admin navigates to practice management section
3. Admin can view, create, edit, or delete practices
4. Changes are saved and reflected in the app
5. Admin can view confirmation of actions

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Clear form labels and error messages
- Proper focus management

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Admin dashboard interface
- Practice management forms
- Data tables and listings
- Authentication and authorization
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Backend
- Admin authentication system
- Practice CRUD APIs
- Role-based access control
- Data validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for admin actions

### Data Models

- Admin user models
- Audit log models
- Permission and role models

### Integrations
- Authentication system
- Content delivery system
- Analytics and reporting
- Email notifications for admin actions

## Dependencies

### Required Capabilities

- **End Date**: TBD

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Admin can access and modify practices (CRUD)
- Admin authentication and authorization works
- Practice changes are reflected in the app
- Admin can view practice listings and details
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Admin interface loads within 2 seconds

- Responsive design for different devices
- Audit trail for all admin actions

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for CRUD operations
- Integration tests for admin workflows
- Security tests for authentication and authorization
- UI tests for admin interface
- End-to-end tests for practice management

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Implement proper role-based access control
- Use secure authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Create audit logging for compliance
- Design for scalability and performance

### Design Considerations
- Design intuitive interfaces for non-technical users
- Provide clear feedback for all actions
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Consider mobile access for admin tasks

### Risk Factors
- Security vulnerabilities in admin access
- Data corruption from improper CRUD operations
- Performance issues with large datasets
- User experience issues for non-technical admins
- Compliance and audit requirements

## Examples

### Implementation Tasks
- Set up admin authentication system
- Create practice management interface
- Implement CRUD operations for practices
- Add role-based access control
- Create audit logging system

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Example practice management API
class PracticeController {
  async createPractice(req, res) {
    try {
      const practiceData = req.body;
      const practice = await practiceService.create(practiceData);
      await auditService.log('practice_created', req.user.id, practice.id);
      res.json({ success: true, data: practice });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
    }
  }
  
  async updatePractice(req, res) {
    try {
      const { id } = req.params;
      const updates = req.body;
      const practice = await practiceService.update(id, updates);
      await auditService.log('practice_updated', req.user.id, id);
      res.json({ success: true, data: practice });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
    }
  }
}
```
