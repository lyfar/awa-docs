# Capability Catalogue

AWATERRA organises product work around enduring capabilities. Each capability anchors a set of features, requirements, and metrics. This catalogue is the stable reference for names, numbering, and purposeâ€”link to it whenever you need to describe where a feature lives.

| 01 | [App Infrastructure](./App-Infrastructure) | Back-end services, architecture foundations, notifications, admin tools |
| 02 | [Visualization & Map Layer](./Visualization-Map-Layer) | Globe, map-based storytelling, spatial UI |
| 03 | [Access](./Access) | Entry points, authentication, permissions |
| 04 | [Identity](./Identity) | Profiles, personalization, language preferences |

## Using this catalogue

- Reference the capability number and name in requirements, specs, and release notes instead of duplicating bespoke descriptions.
- When new capabilities emerge, add them here first so every downstream doc can point to a single source of truth.
- Features inherit their `capability` frontmatter from this list; update both the capability doc and this catalogue if naming changes.
