# Special Practice

## Snapshot
- Type: Event-based ritual crafted by a featured master
- Availability: Unlocked for 24 hours at a scheduled trigger (e.g., 12:12)
- Duration: Fixed by the master, typically ~10 minutes
- Master presence: Required (bio, portrait, context)
- Downloadable: Yes

## Experience
Special Practice celebrates pivotal celestial or cultural moments with a one-time ritual. A master curates the audio journey and contextual narrative, while AWAsoul adopts bespoke visuals that mirror the event theme. The session only unlocks at the scheduled time, building anticipation and reinforcing the importance of collective sync.

## Pop-Up Card Content
- Title highlighting the event or occasion
- Description explaining the meaning and intended impact
- Master profile and call-to-follow prompt
- Countdown timer showing when the session unlocks
- Fixed duration indicator
- Primary `Start` action (active only when the scheduled window opens)

## Operational Notes
- Design the practice card with distinct styling (a Masterâ€™s Planet treatment) to separate it from everyday options.
- Trigger follow-up nudges when the session expires to recap highlights and encourage feedback.
- Archive audio and analytics after the 24-hour window for compliance and future storytelling.
