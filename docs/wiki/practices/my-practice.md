# My Practice

## Snapshot
- Type: Self-logged session (meditation, breathing, mantra, movement, etc.)
- Availability: Always available
- Duration: User-defined with +30 percent grace window before invalidating the log
- Master presence: Not applicable
- Downloadable: No

## Experience
My Practice gives members space to log the modality they are pursuing off-platform. Instead of guided audio, the session runs on a simple countdown timer that adapts to the duration the user enters. AWAsoul reflects the selected activity, offering subtle animations that keep the user anchored without prescribing specific instructions.

## Pop-Up Card Content
- Title: “My Practice”
- Dropdown selector for modality (meditation, breathing, mantra, sound healing, yoga, etc.)
- Manual duration input (minutes) with validation
- Primary `Start` action that triggers the countdown timer

## Operational Notes
- Store each entry as a journal record (date, modality, declared duration, actual completion time).
- Apply grace logic: if the session exceeds the declared time by more than 30 percent, mark it as incomplete to preserve streak integrity.
- Omit download surfaces and highlight the reflective intent of the practice in copywriting.
