# Practices Catalogue

This catalogue contains the stable set of practices available in AWATERRA today. Each entry keeps the core metadata in one place so product, content, and engineering teams stay aligned as we evolve the experience.

:::tip Linked Specs
Capabilities and feature requirements consume this catalogue directly. See [05. Practice capability](/docs/capabilities/05-Practice/index), the [Capability catalogue](/docs/wiki/capabilities/), plus the [Practices List](/docs/features/practices-list) and [Practice Screen](/docs/features/practice-screen) features for how this data flows into product behaviour.
:::

| Practice | Availability | Duration | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Light Practice](./light-practice) | Active for 1 month after release | Fixed ~10 min | Master-led, emphasizes community connection and inner light |
| [Guided Meditation](./guided-meditation) | Two slots: today’s release and yesterday’s encore | Fixed ~10 min | Voice-narrated journey with rotating themes and outcomes |
| [Sound Meditation](./sound-meditation) | Two slots: today’s release and yesterday’s encore | User selects 10, 15, or 20 min | Immersive soundscapes with duration selector and optional master notes |
| [My Practice](./my-practice) | Always available | User-defined with +30% grace window | Self-logged sessions across modalities, stored as journal entries |
| [Special Practice](./special-practice) | Event-based, unlocked for 24 hours at a scheduled time | Fixed (set by master, ~10 min) | Distinct presentation, countdown unlock, master-crafted for rituals |

## How to use this catalogue

- Treat each practice page as the single source of truth for metadata such as duration, benefits, and asset references.
- When a practice changes, update the corresponding page and notify dependent teams (product, design, content, analytics).
- Add new practices here before they appear in feature specs so the rest of the documentation stays consistent.

## Shared Journey Flow

- **Before practice**: The Practice Screen displays the current set of cards (six core types, plus Special Practice when active). Selecting any card opens the pop-up information sheet described on each practice page.
- **During practice**: AWAsoul accompanies every experience with play, pause, finish, and mute controls. Timers adjust per practice rules (fixed, selectable presets, or manual entry), and all guided types stream an mp3 asset while My Practice runs a countdown-only flow.
- **After practice**: Users can react with seven emotive icons, view AWAunit rewards, sustain streak animations, follow the creating master when available, and download audio for all practices except My Practice.
