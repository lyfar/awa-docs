## Snapshot

## Experience
Sound Meditation surrounds practitioners with cosmic tones, bowls, or frequency sweeps that reset the nervous system. The selectable duration keeps control in the user’s hands while AWAsoul syncs subtle visual pulses to the audio landscape. The experience works both for quick resets and deeper dives, depending on what the user chooses before start.

## Pop-Up Card Content

- Short description of the sound source or intention
- Optional master acknowledgements if relevant
- Duration selector with 10, 15, and 20 minute presets

## Operational Notes
- Maintain the two-day rotation with automated expiry so the catalogue stays current.

- Provide download links with licensing data so legal and content teams can audit usage.
