# AWATERRA Wiki

The AWATERRA wiki captures durable knowledge about the product, team, and operations. Unlike feature specs that change sprint by sprint, the wiki holds stable references that everyone can rely on when making decisions.

Use this space for:

- Canonical lists such as practices, assets, and capability definitions.
- Shared language, principles, and product context that should not drift.
- Source-of-truth templates the whole team uses when drafting specs or capability docs.
- Links to deeper references in design files, analytics dashboards, or operational runbooks.

More collections will land here over time. For now, explore the [Practices catalogue](/docs/wiki/practices/) to understand every modality we offer today, the [Capability catalogue](/docs/wiki/capabilities/) to keep requirements aligned, and review the shared templates when kicking off new documentation.
